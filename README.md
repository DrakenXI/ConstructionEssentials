# ConstructionEssentials

## Introduction

### Foreword
"Construction Essentials" is a simple mod for testing my personal models, textures and code.
Construction Essentials have been created to add some blocks who I wanted in modpacks with which I play.
MCreator is used to simplify some parts of mod creation. Yes it is not clean code.
The generation of clean and optimized code is not my priority.
I'm not Java expert and still less Minecraft programmer.
(PHP, JS... are more of my specialties :sweat_smile: )

### Description

Currently, all blocks are purely decorative.

## Blocks

### Sewer pipe
Sewer pipe have a unique behavior when is placed on and against others.
Fully custom model for all possibilities of intersection.
Not a classic cable generation algorithms.

This is not a perfect solution. There are still a lot of behavioral issues when it is placed.
But it is cool for decorative block with no other purpose.

### Caution blocks
Decorative block with all Minecraft colors and black.
I use Minecraft concrete textures for creating caution textures.
(Easiest integration on builds).

### Basic concrete
I hate gray concrete in Minecraft... I have create mine :grin:.

### Other

(Fluids, gas, light, textures...)
